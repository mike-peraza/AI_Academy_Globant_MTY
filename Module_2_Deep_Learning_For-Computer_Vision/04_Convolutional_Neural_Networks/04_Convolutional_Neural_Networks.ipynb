    "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network commonly used in computer vision tasks. They are well-suited for tasks that involve analyzing and understanding visual data, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CNN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of a CNN is designed to effectively process and extract features from images. It typically consists of the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolutional Layers:**\n",
    "   - Convolutional layers are the core building blocks of a CNN.\n",
    "   - They apply a set of learnable filters (also known as kernels) to the input image, which helps in detecting visual patterns and features.\n",
    "   - Each filter performs a convolution operation by sliding across the input image, extracting local features at each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pooling Layers:**\n",
    "   - Pooling layers follow convolutional layers and downsample the feature maps.\n",
    "   - They reduce the spatial dimensions of the input, which helps in reducing the computational complexity and controlling overfitting.\n",
    "   - Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fully Connected Layers:**\n",
    "   - Fully connected layers are traditional neural network layers that connect all neurons from the previous layer to the next.\n",
    "   - They take the high-level features extracted by convolutional and pooling layers and use them for classification or regression.\n",
    "   - The output of the last fully connected layer is connected to the output layer, which produces the final predictions."
